# Segmented-BestfitLines
Segmented Best fit lines algorithm implementation as part of DAA course

# Using the code
Compile and run DAA_Assignment2.cpp
give the C value in the first line where C is the penalty for creating a new line
give the N value that is no.of points that are given as input 
next N lines takes points in the order X1 Y1 as input

# visualising the results
After running the above code the data is stored in ab.txt file
Run plotter.py to visualise the results
